Dataset used: [House Prices of King County](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction/) are explored. 
We create a Neural Network to predict house prices, conformalize our predictions, and do Hypothesis testing for the same.
We also explore the length of our prediction interval and find that as we increase our alpha the length of our intervals also increases.
